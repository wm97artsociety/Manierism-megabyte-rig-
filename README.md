🛡️ Manierism Megabyte Capsule Rig

Overview

Manierism Megabyte Capsule Rig is a blockchain-based mining platform that tracks digital rewards in terms of:

📦 Real Megabytes (MB)

📶 Real Bandwidth (MB/s)

⚡ Real Hash Power (hs) 

🔋 Real Energy (kWh)


This system models rigs with real-world parameters, including kilowatt consumption, data throughput, and incremental rig performance. Every rig is assigned a unique wallet ID, and the system is designed to run continuously for decades, modeling long-term mining efficiency.

🔑 Encryption Key Setup

To ensure secure capsule minting and wallet integrity, the system uses Fernet encryption. A key is generated and stored locally:

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

KEYPATH = "/storage/emulated/0/Download/capsulekey.key"

if not os.path.exists(KEYPATH):
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    with open(KEYPATH, "wb") as f:
        f.write(key)
    print(f"[INFO] Encryption key generated at {KEYPATH}")
else:
    with open(KEYPATH, "rb") as f:
        key = f.read()
    print(f"[INFO] Encryption key loaded from {KEYPATH}")

The key is stored at:
/storage/emulated/0/Download/capsulekey.key

It is used to encrypt wallet files and capsule metadata, ensuring tamper-proof mining logic.

🧠 Reward Logic

Capsules are minted using runtime-valid formulas:

E_virtual = H_cpu × t × k_scale
E_real    = E_virtual / k_real

H_cpu: hash rate (hashes/sec)

t: time interval (seconds)

k_scale: scaling constant (e.g., 1/25,000)

k_real: real-world conversion factor


MB Reward System

Starting Reward Range: Each mining cycle yields a random reward between 1–11 MB.

Scaling: Rewards increase as hash power and runtime grow.

Feedback Loop: More MB → more hash power upgrades → faster MB accumulation.


Formula:

MB_reward = random.randint(1, 11) × growth_factor × (H_cpu / scaling_constant)

MB → Hash Power Donation

1 MB donated = 1 H/s added to rig hash power.

Creates direct feedback loop between community contributions and mining strength.

🧪 Mining Loop

Mining Rewards and Legacy:

Early rewards are small starting out (1–11 MB), but they grow significantly as rigs scale.

Rigs can be passed down to a loved one or someone you care about, allowing them to inherit your rig and continue earning rewards.


Each capsule prints:

Capsule type

MB reward (1–11 MB starting range)

Hash power added

USD/BTC value

Real kWh used

Bandwidth in MB/s


Hash Power Feedback Loop

1. Mining → earns MB (1–11 MB per tick).


2. MB can be spent to upgrade hash power.


3. MB can also be donated to the creator at 1 MB → 1 H/s.


4. More hash power → more MB → compounding growth.

⏳ Rig Lifetime and Max Hash Power

Starting Hash Power: 25,000 H/s

Scaled Max Hash Power (Target HS):


Target_HS = MAX_HASH / 4 ≈ 2.62503205022007E152

Mining Contribution: hash power rises with rewards and donations.

Daily MB Requirement for 75-Year Growth: ~4,566 MB/day

💡 Megabytes as a Foundational Technology

Market Value:

Raw MB: $0.10–$1

Processed MB: ~$5 (RAM, CDs, software)


Future Potential:

Run operating systems directly from MB storage

Power devices without traditional kilowatt plugs

Unlock full OS hash power (e.g., U.S. phone: 77 H/s → unlocked bootloader: 220,000 kH/s)

📊 Capsule Flow Diagram

Hash Power (H_cpu) → Virtual Energy → Real Energy (kWh) → USD Value
Hash Power (H_cpu) → Bandwidth (MB/s) → Capsule Metadata

Feedback:
MB (1–11 per tick) → MB spent/donated → Hash power ↑ → MB ↑

🧬 Runtime Sovereignty

This system respects sovereign valuation laws, allowing symbolic overlays when remixing capsule tiers. All reward logic is runtime-auditable, with finite metrics for MB, kWh, USD, and BTC.

config.py (settings & constants)

wallet.py (wallet class for balance, deposits, withdrawals, and MB→HS donations)

wallet.json (an initialized wallet file that the software will use)

Imports

import os
import time
import json
import random
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet


---------------

wallet.json

> ⚠️ This is stored encrypted on first run by wallet.py.
Here’s what the unencrypted structure looks like before encryption:

No need to install



{
  "address": "rig_wallet",
  "balance_mb": "0",
  "hashpower": "10000",
  "donated_mb": "0"
}

When you first run the wallet, it generates an encryption key (wallet.key) and encrypts this JSON for secure storage.


Altering or tampering with software is not allowed and will not be tolerated or accepted as currency on the rig
