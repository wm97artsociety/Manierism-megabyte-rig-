🔑 Encryption Key Setup

To ensure secure capsule minting and wallet integrity, the system uses Fernet encryption. A key is generated and stored locally:

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

KEYPATH = "/storage/emulated/0/Download/capsulekey.key"

if not os.path.exists(KEYPATH):
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    with open(KEYPATH, "wb") as f:
        f.write(key)
    print(f"[INFO] Encryption key generated at {KEYPATH}")
else:
    with open(KEYPATH, "rb") as f:
        key = f.read()
    print(f"[INFO] Encryption key loaded from {KEYPATH}")

The key is stored at:
/storage/emulated/0/Download/capsulekey.key

It is used to encrypt wallet files and capsule metadata, ensuring tamper-proof mining logic.

🧠 Reward Logic

Capsules are minted using runtime-valid formulas:

E_virtual = H_cpu × t × k_scale
E_real    = E_virtual / k_real

H_cpu: hash rate (hashes/sec)

t: time interval (seconds)

k_scale: scaling constant (e.g., 1/25,000)

k_real: real-world conversion factor


MB Reward System

Starting Reward Range: Each mining cycle yields a random reward between 1–11 MB.

Scaling: Rewards increase as hash power and runtime grow.

Feedback Loop: More MB → more hash power upgrades → faster MB accumulation.


Formula:

MB_reward = random.randint(1, 11) × growth_factor × (H_cpu / scaling_constant)

MB → Hash Power Donation

1 MB donated = 1 H/s added to rig hash power.

Creates direct feedback loop between community contributions and mining strength.

🧪 Mining Loop

Mining Rewards and Legacy:

Early rewards are small starting out (1–11 MB), but they grow significantly as rigs scale.

Rigs can be passed down to a loved one or someone you care about, allowing them to inherit your rig and continue earning rewards.


Each capsule prints:

Capsule type

MB reward (1–11 MB starting range)

Hash power added

USD/BTC value

Real kWh used

Bandwidth in MB/s


Hash Power Feedback Loop

1. Mining → earns MB (1–11 MB per tick).


2. MB can be spent to upgrade hash power.


3. MB can also be donated to the creator at 1 MB → 1 H/s.


4. More hash power → more MB → compounding growth.

⏳ Rig Lifetime and Max Hash Power

Starting Hash Power: 25,000 H/s

Scaled Max Hash Power (Target HS):


Target_HS = MAX_HASH / 4 ≈ 2.62503205022007E152

Mining Contribution: hash power rises with rewards and donations.

Daily MB Requirement for 75-Year Growth: ~4,566 MB/day

💡 Megabytes as a Foundational Technology

Market Value:

Raw MB: $0.10–$1

Processed MB: ~$5 (RAM, CDs, software)

Bandwidth is vauled at $0.42 a mb/s

Kilowatts are based in area growth from regions for example $0.17 a kilowatt a hour

What can megabytes do 

Megabyte do alot of things but you can program you're own cds, sdrams, ssd drives for stroage, digital storage systems, video games, just about any thing out of megabytes even pcs or cell phones with you're own software and logic its all about you're own software and logic to run the system when you deal with window gateway intel ryzen hp any company that deals in software its rooted in their logic to make you're own you must create a system of you're own to produce the right software you need for the tools you want in this blockchain we will learn how to make operating systems, computers, phones and other software together in a safe and team like effort when no one is more valuable then the enxt but everyone is reward with tools to brighten their life


What can bandwidth do bandwidth is special it can run airwaves, phone signals, satellite, and so many other things like radio stations and more 


What can i do with it

You can start a business offering cheap phone services through guest ports of numbers rented from you're phone line where each user has wifi or calling, txting or any feature you want say you have tv program that lets you rent out spaces for cell phone users you can port over their user through a terminal and set them up a tv program, you can run a fm am radio picking up local and world wide channels and so many other features just waiting to a good creatuon to be made loved and used


What about kilowatts 

This one is easy kilowatts was used for electricity to produce quantum json files and harvest energy hopefully with the hopes to quick charge devices within 5 minutes in the future or 1 minutes on lighting speed having this thought is hard because you have to base the formula on electronic abilty and process of mah of phone abilty to a phone only gets 500 mah which is 1 hour to use you must set a file to 475mah to 500 mah no more to receive the right electronic abilty to change the cell phone or device and with that it needs it own logic system and software to do quantum which is not hard but processing in files so it takes time to sort out as we shoot for November for our tesla style launch on charging batteries with our quantum files we will process every test to make the battery charge from slow charge, drip charging, and fast charging, lighting charging when we get it set up correctly then that system will be released to the public 


How did I come up with this formula for bandwidth and electricity? 

I uses the standard formula of each bandwidth and electricity and took it back to square one of the solution using =^2 which does two equations at one time to find a solution my own way of solving the mathematical equations and formulas 

For example


A*B=C
E*Y=H

A*B=C/B/A=H/Y/E=^2CH

it roots the problem back to the root of the answer and allows multiple results just like power symbol 

Whats amazing avout power symbol ^

Is that if you have a lottery ticket

At 3 balls to pick 

30 iptuons 

You have 300 choices

But 27,000 options to win 

It get total number of bet 

But if i take 

3^30 or 30^3 you get roughly 27,000 options 

But you do 3=^30 or 30=^3

You get the exact number it takes to win the game in bets 

Take this to the games ratio of wins for half a year 180 days

You have 50% chance of winning Wrighting down wins for balls

Highest lowest and middles 

Then you play those sets and within 1-20 days you hit a jackpot of a lottery win 

Tricky part getting lottery to pay you sadly but it is fun 


Daily 3

But you do 3=^30 or 30=^3

30^3÷30×3=^2 2700 bets to win

Or if you wanted to win rate

30^3÷30÷3=^2 300 bets in  1.21666666666666666 average win rate per time spand



Daily 4


But you do 4=^40 or 40=^3

40^4÷40×4=^2 256,000 bets to win

Or if you wanted to be 80% win rate at around 300 days

40^4÷40÷4=^2 16000 bets in  43.8356164383561643 average win rate per time spand


Power ball

But you do 5=^69 or 69=^5

69^5÷69×5=^2 113,335,605 bets to win

Or if you wanted to be 80% win rate at around 300 days

69^5÷69÷5=^2. 4,533,424.2  bets in 12,420.3402739726027 average win rate per time spand

Future Potential:

Run operating systems directly from MB storage

Power devices without traditional kilowatt plugs

Unlock full OS hash power (e.g., U.S. phone: 77 H/s on monero → unlocked bootloader: 220,000 kH/s)





Megabytes have always been installed onto a computer in the early days of computers they had 256 megabyte ram and 512 megabyte ram which would run a pc using this logic gave the idea for this blockchain

📊 Capsule Flow Diagram

Hash Power (H_cpu) → Virtual Energy → Real Energy (kWh) → USD Value
Hash Power (H_cpu) → Bandwidth (MB/s) → Capsule Metadata

Feedback:
MB (1–11 per tick) → MB spent/donated → Hash power ↑ → MB ↑

🧬 Runtime Sovereignty

This system respects sovereign valuation laws, allowing symbolic overlays when remixing capsule tiers. All reward logic is runtime-auditable, with finite metrics for MB, kWh, USD, and BTC.

config.py (settings & constants)

wallet.py (wallet class for balance, deposits, withdrawals, and MB→HS donations)

wallet.json (an initialized wallet file that the software will use)



---------------

wallet.json

> ⚠️ This is stored encrypted on first run by wallet.py.
Here’s what the unencrypted structure looks like before encryption:

No need to install



{
  "address": "rig_wallet",
  "balance_mb": "0",
  "hashpower": "10000",
  "donated_mb": "0"
}

When you first run the wallet, it generates an encryption key (wallet.key) and encrypts this JSON for secure storage.


Altering or tampering with software is not allowed and will not be tolerated or accepted as currency on the rig

Updates coming to the blockchain 


 p2p pool for megabytes, hashpower, bandwidth, kilowatts, manierism tokens to exchange, sell and buy while also extraction of megabytes in any size, kilowatts in future, hashpower and bandwith tokens for manierism are special because its the main token and the harder reward meaning its more rare then other mining features but with less usefulness in features at the moment so its a cross road at the moment tell the nft market comes out 

 You're not just mining one reward you are mining a capsule just like when you store a time capsule one is unlocked in time each time you mine a reward unlocking more storage, bandwidth and power for so many useful tools on the internet including megabytes which are the branch of the tree of the internet.
